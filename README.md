# minesweeper
! BE WARNED !
By some miracle, I managed to get the game somewhat working before I gave up.
HOWEVER, it is very scuffed and there are some features that I have not included like the most basic flags.
Also, I played around with my variables to make it somewhat work so some variables may make absolutely 0 sense.
I will be working on it in my free time and hope that I can produce an actual working version of it.
Thanks for dropping by! ^^;
