# Minesweeper
This was just a challenge for myself to see whether I could manage to code a scalable and working version of Minesweeper **only** from vanilla Python.\
That means that I would not be using any modules, packages or libraries (eg. NumPy, PyGame).
As of now, it seems to just about work as intended but no testing has been made to ensure that it really does work, so be prepared if errors arise.\
Currently, I do not have any plans to fix or improve the code but I may do so in my free time.
